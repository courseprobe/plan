h3_title: "How to become a better photographer?"

p1: "Photography is all about skill. It's simple, if you have the skill (even just basic skill of photography), you will be a better photographer than your neighbor. If you want to photograph certain scenes - such as weddings, scenery, portraits etc. it takes knowledge. Knowing dos and don'ts is all the difference between a pro and a smartphone selfie taker. Anyone can pick up a camera but only some can actually take meaningful pictures. In this top selection, we focused on one thing - selecting courses that teach you the actual skills necessary and don't rely on bland and pointless expressions like 'it's 50% luck' or 'you need to have talent'."

greendiv: "Photography can be categorized in may ways. One popular way of doing so is by scene. Most popular scene photography types include: general, journalism, nature, wildlife, macro, portrait, personal, nude, sports, architecture or astrography. All of these can be mastered in our reviewed courses."

p2: "A photography course is not everything. It takes practice. A good instructor will guide you through the theory, but also make you pickup the camera and go out there do some shooting. Skill and practice go hand in hand in making you a better photographer and one cannot exist without the other. If you are really serious about becoming a better photographer, you need to experiment and push yourself. There is no limit. Just your own imagination!"
