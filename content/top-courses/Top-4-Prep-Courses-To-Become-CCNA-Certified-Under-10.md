h3_title: "What's the key to becoming CCNA certified?"

p1: "First it's important to know why do you want to become CCNA certified. Having the priorities and goals set will help you prepare much better for your CCNA exam. You may want to ask yourself when do you want to pass the exam? If the answer is in the next 3 - 6 months then you should plan your preparation with the timeframe in mind. Set aside daily review sessions which don't have to be long, but should be intense and really get your hands dirty."

greendiv: "The CCNA exam consists of about 50-60 questions and takes 90 minutes to finish. Being well prepared is key, but even then the exam can still be stressful as you do only have a limited amount of time to answer the exam questions. This is where you will find all the work you put into your training and studying various materials and mockup questions will pay off"

p2: "What we focused on in our selection are courses that aim to accomplish two thing - give you the theoretical background and make you go through actual example scenarios. All our courses listed here are a great asset to complement your other study material such as books and online guides and will help you boost your self-prep for the CCNA exam significantly."
