summary: "The course is comprehensive and has great insights of key techniques of using contour lines"
review_p1: "A good start on understanding the meaning of contour lines and how to use them in drawing. This course explains and demonstrated the proper technique and ways of creating them. This also clarifies that contour lining only consists of lines without any shades, it will only outline the shadow of highlight which occurs on surfaces that are curved and bend. It will also explain as to why contour line drawing should perform in a very slow way in order to define edges and shapes and to emphasize the depth of the subject.  This course also gave fundamentals of different types of contour lines like crafting and cross. This also teaches the steps of block-in drawing method as the basic foundation of the design."
review_p2: "The course is comprehensive and has great insights of key techniques of using contour lines. The method of combining different kinds of the contour line to create any shape and drawing is also included in this course with well-provided guidelines and examples. Students will also learn the proper way for foreshortening method and how to convey a more realistic drawing.  The instructor is very helpful in keeping his students guided in every step to improve their skills. He also highlighted in his lecture the importance of the concept of the object and how dynamic it will appear on the paper. This course is surely a great approach on any artist who wants to improve their drawing ability."
