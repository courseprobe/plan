The course is a huge help for students who want to use their spare time in a more productive way rather than wasting it somewhere and not learning anything. It allows them to follow up on certain topics that they find confusing and be able to catch up on their current lessons. The instructors teaching method allows novices to understand everything and follow instructions with ease.

Everything was explained straight to the point and have been easy to grasp for the student.The instructor does not overwhelm the students with confusing trigonometry problems upfront. She starts at the fundamentals and then gradually builds up the level of difficulty in order to avoid overwhelming the students. There are a lot of valuable resources and the content of the course was well-organized."
