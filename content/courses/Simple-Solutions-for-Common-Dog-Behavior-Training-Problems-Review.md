Techniques are science-based and provide answers to commonly-faced mistakes during dog training. Examples and illustrations are also included to impart clearer information to the audience. The instructor is engaging and incorporates humor in his lectures. Lessons are humane and highlight the effectiveness of reinforcing positive reinforcement in training as opposed to punishment. The instructor utilizes dog psychology and explains the behavioral theory to help the students understand how a dog's mind works and how his formulated techniques can help in achieving favorable results. However, some students who are new at dog training pointed out the lack of demonstration videos and deemed the techniques to be challenging for novices."
