summary: "An effective teaching method that helps the students learn a new language without having to deal with dull memorization lists. The words are pronounced clearly and repetitively reinforced in each level of the course."
review_p1: "A unique approach to teaching a new language that helps the students remember the words easily. The breakdown of the lessons helps the students to digest the material easily. There are lots of useful common phrases included in this course. The words are pronounced properly and the instructor helps the students know how to pronounce the words in a non-confusing way. The first level of this course gives the students a comfortable foundation in learning a new language and motivates them to go on deeper with learning the course. The instructor has a very good teaching method for the students by reinforcing the materials that they have learned in each lesson and continually building those words."
review_p2: "The students can easily build basic sentences after taking this course and do some basic conversation. The lessons are gradually taught to the students and the previous knowledge keeps on showing up in the later lessons to make sure that the materials are reinforced and the students can be trained to use it from time to time. There are no long lists to memorize in this course and the grammar of the language is presented very well in each lesson. The lessons are easy to follow and there are clear explanations on how to pronounce a word and the process behind it to help the students build a coherent sentence."
