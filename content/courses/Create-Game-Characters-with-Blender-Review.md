summary: "Comprehensive course that discusses all the essential elements in creating a game character using Blender. The lessons are laid-back and the students are given the encouragement to go improvise their own which improves their creativity and skill in using the software."
review_p1: " Extensive course that discusses all game character development using Blender. The instructor uses his humor in all the lessons to make the students comfortable in learning. He gives the students the encouragement to learn more and improvise on their own which develops their creativity. Students can learn a lot about the workflow of hi-res and retopologizing, and animation in Blender. They can easily follow the instructions and make their own model using the anatomy portion of the lesson. The course is perfect for those interested in creating assets for unity because there is a coding portion that is discussed by the instructor in detail. "
review_p2: "The demonstrations are delivered with clarity and simplified enough for non-native English speakers to understand and keep up with the pace of the lesson. The students can see the progress and the exporting of the characters in the game engine which gives them the confidence in producing the same model that was shown in the lesson and to persevere more in learning.This program can cater to beginners up to intermediate learners who want to use Blender and learn several different methods of sculpting and UV mapping which are all explained in-depth. New students can easily learn a lot of techniques in mesh creation, sculpting, and rigging which are helpful in giving them a good grasp of using the software."
