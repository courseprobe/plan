The content is comprehensive but is still manageable in order for the students to follow through smoothly. The visuals used for the lesson were really engaging and helps the students absorb the lesson.

The course is very enlightening and teaches the students a lot about the angels. It challenges the students to go outside their comfort zone and look more towards higher dimension that they have never seen before."
