He can easily explain how to retouch an image and gives the students a starting point for retouching. His techniques are simple and can be easily implemented but deliver results on par with complex techniques. The course discussed the essential elements like raw conversion, color theory, and skin retouching. Perfect course that gives the students a solid foundation in retouching. The instructor discussed different types of image and the type of retouching he has done on those and why. The pace was reasonable for beginners and there is an extensive discussion on dodge and burn since the instructor is very experienced with those process."
