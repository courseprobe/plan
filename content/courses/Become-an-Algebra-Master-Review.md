summary: "This course teaches the fundamentals of Algebra for those who needs a good grasp of the lesson. The instructor is engaging and replies quickly to the questions of the students."
review_p1: " The instructor has a wide knowledge of the material and teaches in a very engaging way. She shows a variety of solution for a single problem which is really helpful for those who are struggling with the topic and she makes sure to reply quickly to those who are asking questions. Her replies are always consistent, detailed and pleasant. Her teaching method is very efficient, she will present the concept and then proceeds on how to solve problems regarding those topics. Each part of the course is composed of a manual, video and then a quiz. The videos are of high quality with no audio problems. All of the other resources are also meticulously designed in order to facilitate the learning of the student."
review_p2: "Solutions are provided for all of the problems inside the course in a PDF form. The lesson materials challenge the students and keep them focused on the lesson. The content was well-organized and the progression of each topic can still be related to the previous knowledge learned earlier in the course. The course also aims to help the student put the problem in the right perspective so they can think of how to solve it in their own ways.  The combination of all the materials used in the course helps solidify the concept in the students. "
