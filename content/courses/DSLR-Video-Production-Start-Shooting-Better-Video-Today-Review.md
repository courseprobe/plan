summary: "A comprehensive course that teaches amateurs how to correctly use the DSLR in order to shoot stunning videos. There are also various topics and techniques that were incorporated in using a camera that can really improve the video-making skills of its students."
review_p1: "This course is an excellent introductory course to video production using DSLR but can also be applied in a mirrorless camera. The lessons cover all the essential elements of making a professionally filmed video. There are lessons in video sizes, f-stop (aperture), frame rates, white light level, microphones, and scene-setting. Camera use was also extensively discussed like what each button do in order for the students to know exactly what each part of the camera contributes to the final video product. The instructor is great at teaching and can keep his student well-engaged with his lessons. The presentation of each topic was professionally done and the concepts are discussed in detail."
review_p2: " Real-life examples along with their practical implementation were also given to the students. This course serves as a great reference material that is easily accessible due to the organized structure of each lesson that students can look back again into as a refresher.The lessons were taught clearly and efficiently to people with various skill levels and helped them understand the technical concepts easily. The teacher is really good at explaining and can go on and on without making the lessons dull and boring for the students. The course serves as a great starting point for amateurs who want to shoot better videos for their personal or professional use."
