summary: "An introductory course that covers the basics up to the advanced details of using Affinity Photo. Comprehensive and well-discussed lessons and great learning materials. The workflow gives the students a good grasp of using the software efficiently."
review_p1: "Comprehensive introductory course for Affinity Photo that does not overwhelm the students with too much new technical terms. It gives the students a great foundation for using the software. The course discusses the features of the software that are much better than PS and the tools it offers. Practical examples were given that can easily be recreated by the students on their own. The workflow of the course is very well-organized and effective at reinforcing the lessons and making the students comfortable with using the software. Additional tips were also given that can making their working time shorter like shortcut keys. The pace and flow are reasonable and allows the students to keep up with the lessons effectively."
review_p2: "Each concept was discussed with great details and the learning flow was slowly progressive. It gives the students a good overview of using the software by teaching them little at a time and then combining all the lessons slowly to help them understand how it all comes together. The videos demonstrate how to use and what situations do the students need to use it and why. The instructor is great at delivering the lessons and incorporates a little bit of humor here and there to make each lesson more appreciated. He shares a lot of his experiences and valuable tips that can help anyone to have a good grasp of the software."
