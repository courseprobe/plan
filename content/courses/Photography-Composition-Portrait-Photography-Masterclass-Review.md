review_p2: "The lessons start with the basics then gradually progress into much more advanced topics to avoid overwhelming the students. It focuses a lot on portraiture and studio lighting which makes a huge difference when taking good photographs. The technical lessons were accompanied by PDFs to supplement the understanding of the students. The course is comprehensive and covers a lot of topics like lighting setups. The instructor is very good at presenting the information and has a very smooth flow. There is also an available Google+ community for the students of the course in which they can show their photos to be critiqued by the instructors so that they can learn which aspect they need to improve on. It provides them with a good learning avenue and a supportive community for their passion or business."
