Great introductory course for those who have no background in programming and would want to learn a new field. The delivery was clear and the instructor tries his best to make the lessons interesting and fun. It helps the students know and understand the essential elements of programming and help them analyze their mistakes better in order to solve them. The course is motivating since the instructor takes his time to get his approach delivered to the students in a much more meaningful way."

The teaching approach is very effective and gives the students the confidence to do their own work and advance much deeper into the topic. It opens a whole new world of opportunity for lots of students and shows them the various way they can utilize the information that they have learned. Really great course for beginners with exams at the end in order to reinforce the material in them. The course is a good stepping stone for students who want to delve deeper into the world of programming."
