review_p1: "A great introduction for those who are struggling in playing Minecraft. This course is perfect for beginners to improve their gameplay as they are provided with many options to improve and set their own pace. It has a lot of information to help new players survive their first day and night venture into the game. Those who have intermediate knowledge of the gameplay might find it boring and repetitive but is perfect for absolute starters since it has a lot of reminders that help solidify the tips into their brain. The course was well-done and the instructor is good at teaching the course. Though it is lacking in certain aspects and leaves a few questions unanswered, it gives enough information that will help the player enjoy and survive the game. "
review_p2: "New players will greatly benefit from the course if they listen to the lesson carefully and repeat some of the lessons in order to practice and experiment a little bit more on their choices during playing the game in order to fully immerse themselves. The instructor did a good job of simplifying the course for total beginners and gives them a great understanding of the fundamentals of Minecraft. The lessons are fun and engaging with a lot of videos to help them follow-through with the instructions in detail."
