review_p1: "A lot of great theoretical concepts were shown in the course that can be put to good use. The insights from the instructor were also helpful and help in growing the ability of the student. Lots of new ideas were presented by the instructor and the ideas are a great asset to be put into own work. The course material is of high quality and comprehensive. It teaches the students to create the personality of the figure and all the intricacies of making the drawing look alive, not just draw. This course is recommended for those who wants to be more dynamic in their animations and drawings. There are exercises that will help the students hone the part that they are not confident of. there are also a lot of great resources for artists  and the course is actually great for both digital and traditional art. "

It gives good hindsight and theoretical knowledge that have practical applications. The instructor is knowledgeable and teaches good techniques to his students. he is very good at explaining the process. He highlights important points and repeats them in order for the students to completely digest the materials. The course provides the students a good foundation in drawing and animation. The whole course is entertaining and relaxing for the students. "
