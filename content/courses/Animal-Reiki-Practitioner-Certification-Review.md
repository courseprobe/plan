summary: "Enlightening course about the holistic approach to animal healing through Reiki. The course content is interesting and the instructor is passionate about sharing her knowledge."
review_p1: "The set-up of the course was clear and organized. It helps people to have an actual self-realization by showing ways on how to use the energy of the body to improve their own lives as well as the people and animals around them. Reiki can be a great therapy for people who are finding their connection in the world. Lisa's teaching style provides a great environment for students to appreciate the lessons very well. She has a great demeanor and has a great talent for teaching. The course covers a wide array of topics but the information was provided in such a way that it does not overwhelm the students."
review_p2: "The course gives a lot of therapeutic help to both the owner and the pet as Reiki provides them the environment that they need. All the learning materials that are available are useful since you can take the class at your own pace. This course is perfect for those who are finding their connection with their animals. The delivery of the content was excellent. The instructor is full of enthusiasm and passion to share her knowledge with everyone who wants to have the same lifestyle. The whole course is an enlightening topic in order for people to understand the animal healing."
