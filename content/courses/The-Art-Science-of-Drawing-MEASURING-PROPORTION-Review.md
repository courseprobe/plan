video_handle: "NGylasz-OLI"
summary: "This course will teach the students on how to use the pencil as a visual measuring device to transfer exact ratio of the subject in their paper or canvas."
review_p1: "Drawing with correct proportion is considered one of the hardest parts because this will need visual measurement based on strong observations. This is exactly what this course is going to teach the students. They will have a better understanding of how the widths, height, and depth of the subject are connected to make a better proportion. It will also teach them how to use the pencil as a visual measuring device to transfer exact ratio of the subject in their paper or canvas. It will also explain the method of angle sighting to get the precise direction and gap between two points of the subject. Additionally, they will also learn how to use the triangulation method to determine the location of an unknown point of the subject."
review_p2: "The presentation of the video is commendable because the setting is like a classroom which is very academic style. The student will really feel that they are learning from a school. The instructor has a great style of teaching, she provided examples of each lesson. She also speaks slowly so that the student can follow through. The close-up shot of her lips is an excellent way to show her student how to correctly pronounce the alphabets. It has a very precise pace and easy to follow instructions. The practice materials and PDF textbook are also valuable for the student in addition to the daily basic conversation and expression that are included in the course. This will definitely boost the student to confidently speak the Japanese language."
