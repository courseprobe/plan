summary: "A great introductory course for undergraduate students who wants to have a solid understanding of probability and statistics. The instructor has a very good humor and motivates his students to work really well."
review_p1: "The course offers a new way of learning a confusing subject. The instructor tries to steer away from the conventional method of teaching inside the classroom. Instead, he tries to incorporate his humor, as well as his skills, to push the students to use the concepts in real life. There are a lot of resources available for the students. A lot of mental work is needed to do the problem set but its level of difficulty is reasonable. The challenges help the students absorb the materials more efficiently and be able to apply the theoretical concepts in real life. The course content is clearly organized and the instructor clearly knows what he is teaching."
review_p2: "Lots of real-world application were seen in the video and gives useful advice on how to utilize Excel. Most of the concepts were explained in a clear way and solutions were given to the students. The breakdown of each answer is helpful for those who are still struggling to take in the content. It helps the student to understand the process clearly rather than just knowing the formulas. The teacher's style of teaching is warm, funny and approachable. His humor removes the struggle of learning in a formal setting and he also addresses difficult concepts. This course is recommended for undergraduate students who want to have a good introduction to the subject before delving into a more advanced course."
