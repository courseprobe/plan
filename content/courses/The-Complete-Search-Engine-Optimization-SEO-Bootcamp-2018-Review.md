review_p1: "If you donâ€™t yet have any experience in SEO or content outreach and you want to onboard a fast and extremely easy to understand course about this topic, then this is the course for you. When completed, you will have a solid understanding of SEO, content outreach and other search engine related topics. Most importantly, you will have the equipment and knowledge necessary to help you rank your website better and become more visible on Google, Bing and other search engines."
review_p2: "From a beginners viewpoint, this course is fantastic. The course progresses in just the right pace and is very informative. Terms are easy to understand and the author does not overload you with the unnecessary. Content is itemised into sections that are easy to grasp. The author uses real-life examples to clear up some more advanced terminology, which is nice. Although the course could go into more depth in some areas (especially content outreach), overall we rate this course as a great intro into SEO and found it to be a great online learning experience."
