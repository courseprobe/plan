review_p1: "Data science can be an overwhelming field for some beginners around the world and this course aims to provide the knowledge needed in order to have a good grasp of the field. It is quite technical for a novice but is very reasonable with its workload since you will progress as you go deeper with the course and the topics were made to be simpler. It has a lot of interesting exercises that helps on improving the knowledge about the topic. The course is excellent since it shows the theoretical and practical aspect of the topic. The course is information-heavy but a lot of content that will be learned throughout the course will prove to be useful in real life."
review_p2: "It started with easy concepts then gradually goes into more advance topics and highlights all the important concepts to be learned. There is a lot of material available for those who are very keen on improving on the subject and is wonderfully detailed. One suggestion on improving the course is to go into more detail on some of the advance topics of the course since some of it were just skimmed through. Overall, the course format helped on improving knowledge about different concepts and the exercises supplemented those and made the course fun and immersive."
