summary: "Comprehensive course about using Xamarin Forms that can get you into app development in no time. The instructor was straight to the point and highlights the importaant points."
review_p1: "The course is comprehensive and gives a student great foundation to go into actual app development. The learning materials were concise and easy to understand. Lots of new concepts were given and demonstration in real-world was also done. Putting the theoretical part into practice is helpful for students to become more practical. Brilliant instructions were given and everything was explained clearly that can get you working in app development in a short time. The instructor is very engaging and tries to make his content up-to-date. The content of the course is broken into bits and pieces which helps the students to digest the information more easily. He really goes in-depth explains the process behind the concept rather than forcing students to memorize. "
review_p2: "The whole course covers a great span of topics but does not get too overwhelming. Great techniques were given in order for students to be able to have to make sure their codes are clean. There are also plenty of supplemental exercises for each section in order to make sure that the students were really able to get the concept. It gives a good overview of Xamarin and how to utilize a cross-platform database for mobile apps. This course is perfect for students with intermediate knowledge of the subject as some knowledge of the C# is needed for some parts of the course."
