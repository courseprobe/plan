review_p1: "This course is very detailed and well structured which makes it suitable for beginners and for those who have already basic knowledge of Photoshop but still wants to improve their skills. The main focus of this course is basically enhancing and creating amazing images and photos. The student will learn that whenever they need to create a project it is very important that they will keep the original images untouched and just make a duplicate of the photo where they can edit and add effects. The main reason for this is that they can always go back to the original images if they made a mistake or in any case, they will be needing the original.
