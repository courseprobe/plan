review_p1: "This is exactly the right course for any artist who wants to improve their ability and to deepen their understanding of creating shading in drawing or art. It has all the fundamental and tools they needed to learn how to do and perform the shading techniques. It explains the basic rules of shading, like identifying the local color, the direct and indirect light source, and color and value. They will also learn how the shades form in different kinds of shape like cylinders or cones, sphere and flat sides depending on the light atmosphere. Students can also learn the rule of shading a hollow object by simply following the direction of the light. They will familiarize with different kinds of shadow outlines like the cast, core, lighter and brighter shadow. They will also gain knowledge on how the light behaves in order to create a realistic art and illusion."
review_p2: "This course will also teach on how to improve pencil control and the correct force to put on the pencil. It is important to have a polish control on the pencil and have the right knowledge on how the light works, to help the student develop sensitiveness in their hands and eyes in order to make a perfect shading of their subject. The instructor gave a clear explanation of each lesson and well-detailed techniques of creating the different texture of shading. He also gave great examples and how and what is to be done on certain objects and forms. This course will definitely improve the drawing ability of any artist."
