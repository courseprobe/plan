It has a nice approach on how to read more effectively in this age where people are overwhelmed with information available. it gives the students a better foundation and framework in order to read more in the future. the techniques that were shown were very effective like relying on photo reading which is helpful in reading faster. The course takes a new approach to reading and how to put all the things that the people had to learn into action as fast as possible."
