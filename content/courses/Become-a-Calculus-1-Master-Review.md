summary: "Refresher course for those who wants to brush up their skills in Calculus. There are quizzes to challenge the students and materials are well-organized."
review_p1: "Great course for refreshing knowledge in Calculus. The content covers an extensive topic about Calculus and is well-balanced. The explanations are delivered with clarity and the instructor has a very pleasant voice that can keep the students engaged with the lesson. It is a good reference that is easily accessible just in case they need it for real-life application. The videos are well-organized and concise. The videos are a good way to reinforce the topic since using books will only provide notes and the videos add life to the topic as well so that the students can see the various demonstrations on some problems. "
review_p2: "The instructor is articulate with her words and can share her point across easily. It teaches a lot about certain topics like derivatives. There are also great examples and quiz questions that can solidify the material in each student by letting them apply the lessons and challenge their critical thinking. The course starts from the basic then gradually moves forward to the practical application of the subject so that it does not overwhelm the students. The instructor is engaging and answers promptly all the question in Q & A. There are also additional learning resources that are great for practicing."
