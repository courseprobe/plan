Other digital nomads advisors would only go into the fun part, traveling. It is also important to know how to gain the money needed for that and how to make it last and the course did address that part. The course provides a lot of great insight into the life of a digit nomad and actually gives websites that would be useful for those who are dreaming of that lifestyle.
