It teaches the students all the food that is needed and gives them a healthy diet plan for an effective fat loss. The content was comprehensive and teaches the students a lot about nutrition. Although it is packed full of information, the content does not overwhelm the students since it was taught straight to the point and uses layman terms for beginners. Felix is a great and wonderful instructor. He is insightful and delivers the information with clarity. He teaches the basics of nutrition and how the students can apply those concepts to tailor their own goals like losing weight or building muscles. "

The analogies given fit perfectly and makes the whole course less complicated. It saves a lot of students time by doing a scientific-approach and cutting through all those unscientific diets that can be seen online. The videos are easy to follow and the instructor is knowledgeable about nutrition. This course is perfect for those who do not have a background in nutrition and wants to know the right thing to do in order to have a healthy life."
