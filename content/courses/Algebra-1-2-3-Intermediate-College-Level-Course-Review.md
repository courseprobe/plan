summary: "Foundation course or as a refresher, this course perfectly delivers accurate information to the students in a simplified way. The instructor makes sure that the foundations were laid before progressing into more difficult concepts."
review_p1: "This course is a life-saver for those who are struggling with their Algebra. The instructor is very detailed but makes sure that the student understands the concept very well. He addresses the foundational elements of Algebra so that beginners would not confuse as they progress with their lesson. Important points were highlighted by the instructor and explain the material with clarity. All the lecture are concise and presented in a very simplified way. He can easily get his point across and engages with his students very well. After addressing the basics, he would then go into an in-depth explanation of certain topics and will explain the mechanisms of certain things."
review_p2: "The pace is perfect for those who are not good at mathematics. A lot of helpful examples were presented in the lecture that helps students to get the concept more clearly. The course is organized well and gradually progresses so that it does not overwhelm the students. This course is highly recommended for those who want to take graduate records examination but is not familiar with the American educational system. Some recommendations for the course would be to provide supplemental exercises outside the video. This course is beginner-friendly and can also act as a great refresher course."
