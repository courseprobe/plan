summary: "Nice lesson about watercolor painting that discusses all the basics in order to give the students a starting point in the painting. The course discusses the basics and goes in-depth with the lessons."
review_p1: "An in-depth lesson for watercolor painting from an instructor with over two decades of experience. From the beginning, the instructor clears up and discusses all the tools and materials that the student will need in her class. She clears up some of the confusion about the materials like the difference between student and artist grade paint and recommends a lot of paints that would be great to work with. She also cleared up the difference between cakes of paint and tubes and most common questions that beginners might have. The lessons are easy to follow and fill in some of the knowledge gaps that people might have. "
review_p2: "The demos are clear and have good explanations that are easy to follow. The discussion of color selection was helpful in teaching the students the type of paint that they should work within a certain art. The course also gave the students a solid understanding of tonal ranges. There are a lot of professional insight and tips for total beginners in the course. It teaches the basics of color, form, texture, smooth application, paint to water ratio, color graduation and a lot more that would be really helpful for a beginner to make a great artwork. this course is great for beginners as it teaches them where to start from and the techniques that they could use while working."
