It also teaches the students on how to utilize links to drive people to their site in order to make views and some money without having to pocket out some cash for capital. The instructor answers all the questions promptly and helpful in guiding his students through some complex parts of the course. He also shares a lot of tactics that can be easily implemented by the students on their own and are proven effective for businesses. "
review_p2: "The course gives a lot of methods and techniques to generate passive income. The instructor provided some of his personal insight into the lesson and taught the whole course in a concise way. One problem that students might have is some of the terms are not well defined and might confuse them and some of the topics are not discussed in-depth but there are many parts of the course that can still benefit the student. There is a step-by-step demonstration of the videos which is good for the students who want to know the process firsthand. The course provides loads of info for newbies that are easy and feasible."
