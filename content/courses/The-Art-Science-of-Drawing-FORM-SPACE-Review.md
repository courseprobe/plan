summary: "The students learn how to draw basic forms to create a 3-dimensional method like cubes, spheres, cone, cylinder and other kinds of shapes."
review_p1: "Students and artist will have a better understanding of form & space and their importance in creating depth in the art and defining the objects in space. They will learn how to draw basic forms to create a 3-dimensional method like cubes, spheres, cone, cylinder and other kinds of shapes. How these forms will work when combining together to make a more realistic artwork. It will also explain that when analyzing the basic forms artist should consider that these forms might also appear in the negative. The student will also learn the rule of perspective, the objects that are closer appear larger in the drawing and objects that are further away should appear smaller. Tips and technique are also given for creating shades in the 3D dimensional drawing, considering how the light source will affect the object."
review_p2: "By taking this course student will gain great knowledge not only for creating form and its relation with space but they will gain on how to make their drawing better and better. This will allow them to bring out their creativity and imagination to make an effective artwork. The instructor is an exceptional teacher, he is very knowledgeable and expert in what he does. He always encourages his student and is very keen to see them improve and enhance their skills. His course was full of great information and he has given a wonderful example so his student can follow the structure of the lesson. The concept, of course, is very clear and delivered in a systematic and understandable way. This will increase the confidence of the student to create and make amazing artwork."
