review_p1: "Learning another language is always a challenge but at the same time it is fun and exciting and this course is no different. The students will be learning the basic Japanese language, the vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, listening and reading. Students will also have a better understanding of the different kinds of Japanese languages i.e. Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji, its function and proper uses in creating a sentence. The course consists of writing and pronunciation of Japanese alphabets. This is a great way to learn the proper stroke and proper way to write the letters as it was demonstrated carefully in this course. The lessons are well categorized in sections making it easy for the student to go back and review the previous lessons."
review_p2: "The presentation of the video is commendable because the setting is like a classroom which is very academic style. The student will really feel that they are learning from a school. The instructor has a great style of teaching, she provided examples of each lesson. She also speaks slowly so that the student can follow through. The close-up shot of her lips is an excellent way to show her student how to correctly pronounce the alphabets. It has a very precise pace and easy to follow instructions. The practice materials and PDF textbook are also valuable for the student in addition to the daily basic conversation and expression that are included in the course. This will definitely boost the student to confidently speak the Japanese language."
