summary: "Beginner-friendly course that gives the students a solid foundation on music theory. It gives a lot of techniques that motivate the students to go and improvise on their own."
review_p1: "This course is a combination of all three of Music Theory for Electronic Musicians classes which are: Music Theory for Electronic Musicians, and Music Theory for Electronic Musicians 2, and Music Theory for Electronic Musicians 3. This course doesn’t require any instruments nor any background in music. It has a manual for beginners in producing music using the harmonic techniques of the professionals. This course will help you improve your tracks by understanding how to build chords and melodies that work together, use the circle of fifths to generate new ideas for your own tracks, understand and apply minor chords and work within minor keys to write compelling melodies and baselines. "
review_p2: "The explanations are informative and easy to understand especially for beginners. The instructor is engaging and incorporates humor in his lectures. He covers the material in depth and gives real-world applications and examples which contains a good balance between theory and practical application. The in-depth song analysis sections are also useful. The approach of the courses is what people wanting to produce on Ableton wants to see: the teacher opens the piano roll, starts drawing notes, explaining concepts, messing around with the notes while explaining why he is doing so, etc. This course is very effective and to the point which is really good for amateurs."
