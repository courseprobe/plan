review_p1: "Great course in engaging the students to learn a new language. The instructor has a very fun personality that makes learning memorable. He incorporates some of his humor in order to make learning a new language much more fun and bearable. His real-life experiences are also said in order to give some examples to the students. The teaching method is effective and can keep the students entertained without failing to absorb the lessons. There is a great support available for the students and a website for them to download the PDFs to supplement their studying."
review_p2: "The lessons are compact and easy to remember for the students. It made the process of learning a new language, especially Chinese, less intimidating by breaking down the lessons into smaller segments so as not to overwhelm the students with too much information in that they cannot remember anything. There are great lessons supported by well-organized materials that give the students a strong grasp of the fundamentals of Chinese language. There is also a demonstration in which the building blocks of every Chinese character is shown to make it easier for the students to remember things. The instructors can convey information clearly and provides a lot of relevant tips for the lesson."
