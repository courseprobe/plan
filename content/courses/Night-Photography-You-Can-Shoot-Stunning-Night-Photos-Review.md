The demonstrations are simple and can be easily done by the students. This course is a huge help for people who have a poor grasp on how to take stunning night photos as it teaches them the settings, techniques, and editing they need to know to take better pictures. The demonstrations in the Lightroom were practical and taught the students how to edit the photos perfectly while maintaining its natural look."

The instructor also provides a good analysis of the photos that they have taken and explained why such adjustments are needed. The photos that were taken can be downloaded and practiced on by the students which are great in reinforcing the lessons learned in the course. The course encourages the students to go out and experiment on their own using the knowledge they have learned and examples that they have seen in the course."
