summary: " Interesting course that shows a detailed process of making the famous Moroccan tea. The instructions were clear and provided an interesting historical background of the tea for curious students."
review_p1: "A short course in making the most popular and amazing drink from Morocco. The course is great for those who are curious about making the tea as well as the history behind it. The history of the tea is discussed in detail in order to give the students a background of the drink that they are making. The course provided a step-by-step demonstration to the students which will enable them to follow the process easily. The pace is slowed down in order to enable the students to take in the steps and also to easily keep up with the procedures of making the tea. "
review_p2: "The contents were broken down into various lectures that will show various steps and guidelines to the students. The whole course is concise and enjoyable to those who enjoy drinking tea or to those who want to explore a new culture through their food. The course is practical and can easily be implemented by the students on their own if they follow the instructions really well. It might be hard to source the tea but the results are well worth it. Very interesting course that shows a great aspect of Moroccan culture through its most popular drink."
