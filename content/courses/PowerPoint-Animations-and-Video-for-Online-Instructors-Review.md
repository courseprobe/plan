about_instructor: "Alan Simpson is the award-winning author of over 115 computer books published throughout the world in over a dozen languages. Being an instructor for nearly four decades, made him deeply involved in technology since the earliest days of personal computing, serving first as programmer and consultant, and more recently as a web developer. However, his master's degree in the psychology of learning and motivation prepared him well for sharing his extensive technical knowledge."

summary: " Helpful course for advancing PowerPoint presentation skills. The information is well-presented from a humorous instructor and will effectively change the way the students present their ideas."
review_p1: "The course was very useful even with the limited knowledge of computing, it can give information and apply all the techniques. As it starts with very basic info and progressively builds up, all the information is given in a short amount of time. Also, the instructor was able to express each step in a very clear way and gives you all the tools you need to create a very smashing video. He was able to give great insights into PowerPoint and how to use its capabilities and gave sources of material to improve any PowerPoint project. He demonstrated a good sense of humor, keeping the course fun."
review_p2: "Live examples of exactly how to use the effects and through the double system of mac and windows and a reasonable walkthrough for creating video output are very useful for the students. A very helpful for animation knowledge about Powerpoint was also included. However, the instructor started speaking faster as the course progresses which makes it hard to keep up at times. And since its advance course, some of the beginner stuff is just that for beginners that advance should already know. Overall, excellent intro to basic Powerpoint animation. Easy and straightforward explanation of basic Powerpoint actions that are immediately relevant and useful."
