The course is effective for students to improve their capabilities and see fast improvement using the techniques given in the course. the teaching style is great for total beginners as everything was explained in-depth. Tyler was very straight-forward with the topic but also incorporates humor in each lesson so that the students would have a fun time learning. "
review_p2: "The course focuses a lot on the concept and its application which helps the students to be able to experiment with their own since they are taught the process behind each music. The instructor takes his time in teaching his students the overview of the lesson and then proceeds to do a slowed-version of the lesson for those who still do not get the entirety of the lesson. It is an excellent course for musicians of various backgrounds since it gives great exposure to various music and new ideas to experiment with and develop as a guitarist. "
