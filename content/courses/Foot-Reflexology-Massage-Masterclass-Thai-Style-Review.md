summary: "Mark does a fabulous job explaining all aspects of the Thai Foot Reflexology Massage. This course will make you feel confident in carrying out foot reflexology methods. "
review_p1: "After this course, people are very confident in carrying out a huge variety of foot reflexology methods. The only issue with this course is that Mark demonstrates the methods on his 9-year-old son, so a few of the hand positions need to be modified as there are small changes on larger feet.  There is an in-depth explanation but also felt like the info could have been condensed to get straight to the point and save time. This is not the first course from Mark that could be enrolled in, he is really good at explaining concepts, very thorough and engaging. He doesnâ€™t keep anything to himself and seems to give the best for the students. This is a highly recommended course and inspires the students to take more lessons from him. It is a pleasure to learn with him."
review_p2: "Those who have done traditional Chinese reflexology will like how Mark showed the differences in charts and made a point about treating the whole foot. Students who have been doing traditional reflexology as a massage professional can compare Thai reflexology with what they learned in here. Mark's course is excellent, both for the professional practitioner and for a person interested in offering a session to friends and family. The pointers included about setting up a favorable environment for the client are also excellent, as are the explanations on body mechanics, useful tools, and the way the Thai practice reflexology."
