p1: "At CourseProbe we do what we do best, we review courses. As professional course reviewers we have gone through literal thousands of courses online. I believe you would agree that that's quite a lot. And as such, we are in a great position of being able to say: this is worth your time and this on the other hand not so much."

greendiv: "Our staff pick page is all about quality, rahter than precise topic coverage. The course can be about cooking or how to create you own lavalamp. As long as the coures has close to 5 stars, it can be featured here."

p2: "Becoming a master of anyting takes time. We believe that this time is valuable and should not go to waste. We consider finding the best coures and reviewing them a waste of time - that is if this is left to the student. That's why we exist. Cudos to our community! You guys are an awesome bunch."
